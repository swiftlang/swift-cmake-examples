# Contributing to swift-cmake-examples 

## How to submit a bug report

Please ensure to specify the following:

* Swift-CMake-Examples commit hash
* Platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)
* CMake version
* Swift version
* Clang version
* Simple steps to reproduce
  * Failing CMake command invocation

## How to submit a new example

Please keep examples self-contained; each example should be self-contained and
not require parts from other examples. If a new example requires additional
library or tool support from the system, the additional requirement should be
indicated clearly.

At this time, examples require [Swift](https://github.com/apple/swift),
[CMake](https://github.com/kitware/cmake), and
[Ninja](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja), although some may have
requirements for other compilers.

To contribute new examples, please open a pull request at
https://github.com/apple/swift-cmake-examples.
